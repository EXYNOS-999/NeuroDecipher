# NeuroDecipher

This repo hosts the codebase for reproduce the results for the ACL paper [Neural Decipherment via Minimum-Cost Flow: from Ugaritic to Linear B](http://people.csail.mit.edu/j_luo/assets/publications/NeuroDecipher.pdf). Data preparation is also documented in relevant folders.
Still cleaning up the codebase.  Stay tuned for more updates.
